A Simple PHP based online trivia with a host.

This project was a basic trivia app that was created in a few hours for use with a large group online trivia. The host was able to control the game and collect/score answers via the admin section of the site.

If you know how to set up a MySQL Databased in PHP My Admin and are able to self host the pages then this trivia site might work for you.
